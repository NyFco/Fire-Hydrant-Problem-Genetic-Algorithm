# Fire-Hydrant-Problem-Genetic-Algorithm

There's a city divided into 10x10 blocks.
Each block has its own fire rate.
There's also a river in the city which divides the city into 2 areas which are connected with 2 different bridges.

We want to find the best block to put our fire station in, So the chosen block should be more close to the blocks with more fire rate.
